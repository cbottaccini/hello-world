# hello-world
This is a test repository to get started.
I've read people's git hubs but never used it for myself so this is a chance to do that. 
I'm also in the process of learning python in prep for taking a graduate course in machine learning
So expect a lot of python here!
Before that the langauge I knew best was Java, with a little C/assembly langauge/fortran and other miscellaneous from 
universit time.
